*** Tweaks Needed***
--------------------
--- 'updateMap()' was needed in Actions to reset the Map zoom per requirement. Zoom set in configs files didn't work properly.
--- Called 'addDataToMap()' on each Dropdown Select
--- Custom colors needed to each filter configs layer

*** Actions ***
--- Source src/store/actions/dataActions.js
--- 'loadDataToMap()' functions loads initial Data on Component Mount.
--- 'toggleLayerVisibility()' toggles given layer visibility on Checkbox Change
--- 'filterDataByWardNo()' filters data by given Ward Number on Dropdown Change

*** Issues ***
--- kepler.gl actions are complicated to implement
--- actions parameters are not well defined
--- Filter adds the last layer color as default color(fixed).
--- Currently loads data from start on each Dropdown Select.
--- Adding new Filters and Layers by using built-in actions needs fix.
--- Data fetch is slow.
--- Legend Color types need fix
--- Legend 'pType' Spelling and Multi-pType issues.
