*** Components ***
------------------
--- Custom Kepler.gl Components added in src/components/KeplerGl.js
--- Custom Dropdown Menu in src/components/DropdownMenu.js
--- Styles added in src/components/css/
--- Custom Side Panel Components in src/components/

*** Data and Configs ***
------------------------
--- Custom Configs in src/components/configs/
--- Datasets (both CSV and JS export) in src/data/
--- Separate configs made for each Dropdown Menu

*** Redux Store ***
-------------------
--- Redux Store and Actions in src/store/
--- Map Window Real Time Resize handled in src/App.js
--- Store Connected in src/index.js

*** Tweaks Needed***
--------------------
--- 'updateMap()' was needed in Actions to reset the Map zoom per requirement. Zoom set in configs files didn't work properly.
--- Called 'addDataToMap()' on each Dropdown Select
--- Custom colors needed to each filter configs layer

*** Actions ***
--- Source src/store/actions/dataActions.js
--- 'loadDataToMap()' functions loads initial Data on Component Mount
--- 'filterDataByWardNo(wardNo)' loads filtered data by Ward No on Map state change. Ward No is added to KeplerGlMap State.
--- KeplerGlMap State changes if different Dropdown Selected using 'displayFilteredByWardNo(wardNo)' passed down to DropdownMenu as props.

*** Issues ***
--- kepler.gl actions are complicated to implement
--- actions parameters are not well defined
--- Filter adds the last layer color as default color(fixed).
--- Currently loads data from start on each Dropdown Select.
--- Adding new Filters and Layers by using built-in actions needed fix.
