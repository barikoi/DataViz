*** Components ***
------------------
--- Custom Kepler.gl Components added in src/components/KeplerGl.js
--- Custom Dropdown Menu in src/components/DropdownMenu.js
--- Custom Checkbox Menu in src/components/CheckboxMenu.js
--- Styles added in src/components/css/

*** Data and Configs ***
------------------------

--- Template config made for filtered and unfiltered cases.

*** Redux Store ***
-------------------
--- Redux Store and Actions in src/store/
--- Map Window Real Time Resize handled in src/App.js
--- Store Connected in src/index.js

*** Tweaks Needed***
--------------------
--- 'updateMap()' was needed in Actions to reset the Map zoom per requirement. Zoom set in configs files didn't work properly.
--- Called 'addDataToMap()' on each Dropdown Select
--- Custom colors needed to each filter configs layer

*** Actions ***
--- Source src/store/actions/dataActions.js
--- 'loadDataToMap()' functions loads initial Data on Component Mount.

*** Issues ***
--- kepler.gl actions are complicated to implement
--- actions parameters are not well defined
--- Filter adds the last layer color as default color(fixed).
--- Currently loads data from start on each Dropdown Select.
--- Adding new Filters and Layers by using built-in actions needs fix.

*** Changelog ***
-----------------
--- Added Checkbox Menu for Layer Selection
--- Added Checkbox functionality with 'toggleLayerVisibility(layerIndex, checked)' action.
--- Added Filter functionality with 'filterDataByWardNo(wardNo, pointChecked, polygonChecked)' action.
--- Added 'setLayerVisibility(config, layerIndex, visibility)' utility function.
--- Added 'setFilterValue(config, wardNo)' utility function.
--- Added 'ward_number' column into Places data programmatically for testing purpose. Need 'ward_number' column in Places data.
